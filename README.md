# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
  Timely delivery is important because it deepns client trust, makes sure you don't demoralise your team and ensures you don't go over budget. The way managers can ensure they deliver on     time is by setting realistic timelines, including buffer time in case of delays and communicate clearly with stakeholders.
  
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
  Effective cost control contributes to the success of a software project by making sure the project within the budget. There are a variety of strategies project managers can use to   
  prevent budget overruns. These including defining a clear scope for the project within the initial requirements, monitor actual costs vs planned budget, identify high cost risks early   
  and ensure you have a risk response budget.
  
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
  Waterfall method: is linear, goes step by step and delivers one product. It's advantages include clear structre, easier timeline estimation, easy to track and easier to budget. It's disadvantages include that adaptation is nearky impossible to do, detecting bugs happens very late and has a high risk of failure if requirements change.   
  
  Agile method: is flexiable, deploys software in smaller versions. 
 
  Advantages:   Allows for easy adaptation to the project
                Delivers many betas and prototypes of working software
                Bugs are detected and fixed very early
  
  Disadvantages:  Harder to make accurate timelines
                  Harder to keep track of and document
                  Requires more involvement from clients
                
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
  Project that would benifit from the Agile method are ones that need constant updates and patches such as mobile apps ,projects with unclear requirements and software as service.
  Projects that would benifit from a waterfall method are ones with clear unchanging requirements. Examples of this would be company intranet and low risk projects/ 
  
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
  Method for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project are analys the requirements, testing(automated or otherwise) and peer review. 
  High standards are important because they prevent costly failures, enhances user experiences, protects brand reputation and reduces techinal debt.
  
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
  It prevents scope creep, sets clear exepectations, improves resource allocation and enhances risk management.
  A WBS is a method of breaking down a project into smaller and manageable bits. It is useful because delegates each task to a team member, tracks progress effectively and reduces the risk   of missing important details.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
  The benifits of detailed schedules provide clear timelines, allow for proper resource allocations, highlights potential risks early and provides clear expectations for clients.
  Grant charts help by creating clear timeline visualization, shows related tasks, moniter progress and allows for better planning.
  
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
  The main issues my software aims to address is identifying AI generated content videos, auido and pictures. This is important due to the rising use of AI in spreading fake information 
  and it's use in scams.    

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
  It saves time, money, allows for better planning, creation of potential contingencies as well as allowing for a clear way to measure progress.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
  An AI video detector

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
  

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?


## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
